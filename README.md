# Fractal Generator

Welcome to the **Fractal Generator**, an advanced visualization tool designed to explore and analyze the fascinating world of fractals. This project provides a comprehensive set of methods and algorithms to study complex fractal structures like the **Mandelbrot set**, **Julia sets**, and their generalized forms.

Whether you are a **mathematician**, a **student**, a **developer**, or simply curious about fractals, this tool lets you dive deep into their properties, rendering techniques, and mathematical intricacies.  
It is intended both for educational purposes and for anyone interested in experimenting with fractal visualization.

Feel free to explore the code, run the application, and customize it to suit your needs.  
**Contributions and feedback are welcome!**
