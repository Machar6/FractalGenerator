# Fundamentals of Fractal Theory

## Iterating Process

The iterating process begins with a complex function of the form:

`z_{n+1} = f(z_n)`

An initial value `z_0` is chosen, and the function is applied iteratively:

`z_1 = f(z_0),  z_2 = f(z_1), ...,z_n = f(z_{n-1})`

This sequence of values `{z_0, z_1, z_2, ... }` is called the **orbit** of `z_0`.

## Behavior of the Orbit

The behavior of an orbit can be classified into three main types based on the iteration process:

- **Convergence**: If the sequence of iterated values `{z_n}` converges to a fixed point.
- **Divergence**: If the sequence `{z_n}` tends to infinity as `n -> ∞`.
- **Periodicity**: If the sequence `{z_n}` starts repeating itself after a certain number of iterations.

Let's define the **Generalized Mandelbrot** and **Julia sets** for a general exponent `d`, and later extend the discussion to transcendental functions like sine, cosine, and the exponential function.

## Generalized Mandelbrot and Julia Sets

Both the Generalized Mandelbrot and Julia sets are generated by iterating the function:

`z_{n+1} = z_n^d + c`

where `d ∈ Q` and `c` is a complex constant.

### Generalized Mandelbrot Set

In the Generalized Mandelbrot set, starting from `z_0 = 0`, we iterate the function:

`z_{n+1} = z_n^d + c`

for each value of c in the complex plane.  
- If the resulting sequence `{z_n}` **remains bounded** after a set number of iterations, then the point `c` belongs to the Generalized Mandelbrot set.
- If the sequence **diverges** `(i.e., |z_n| -> ∞)`, then c does not belong to the set.

### Generalized Julia Set

For the Generalized Julia set, we keep `c` **fixed** and iterate the function:

`z_{n+1} = z_n^d + c`

for different initial points `z_0`.  
The structure of the Julia set depends heavily on the value of `c`, showing rich and complex behavior.
